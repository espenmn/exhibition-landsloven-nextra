# Treatment of thieves then and now

The older provincial laws before the Laws of the Land describe an almost merciless practice of punishing theft.
Thieves were usually to be executed or to lose their freedom, in addition to facing fines paid through the confiscation of property.
The Laws of the Land, which recognized differences in the seriousness of thefts and stipulated punishments accordingly, marked a radical departure from earlier legal praxis.
One had to steal many things and repeatedly to face the death penalty, and fines were preferred to corporal punishment. 
If one was hungry and in need, one could escape punishment altogether. 
The Laws of the Land can clearly be seen as a lenient legal system  compared to the older provincial laws.
Perhaps this merciful approach was because King Magnus was inspired by the Franciscan ideals that he was taught as a young man. 
When Christian V’s Norwegian Code replaced the Laws of the Land in 1687, physical punishment—flogging and branding—became the standard punishment for theft.
In the event of repeated or serious theft, one could be convicted to lifelong slavery—that is, deprivation of freedom in the form of penal servitude.
If one escaped and continued to steal, one could be hanged.
As a clear warning, branding irons were often shaped like gallows.
The hanging, branding, and flogging of thieves were abolished in 1789.
Today, theft is, in most cases, punishable by fines and is categorized into snatching , petty theft, theft, and aggravated theft.
Only the biggest and most serious thefts  are punishable by prison sentences.
Today, we look at the corporal punishment methods of the past with horror.
People in the Middle Ages would probably have been equally bemused by today’s extensive use of deprivation of freedom as punishment and reform.
In the Middle Ages, prison was almost unknown, although one could be held in custody until trial and judgement.
The deprivation of liberty came with later ideas.
