# Archbishop Jon Raude

1280 was a dramatic year both for King Magnus and for the powerful Archbishop Jon Raude (archbishop 1267-1282).
The king died, and the archbishop had to flee to Sweden, where he died two years later.
The barons took over the power together with Queen Ingeborg, in the name of the king’s underage son Erik.
Archbishop Jon Raude was educated as a cross-brother in Nidaros in the 1250s.
In 1266, he travelled as an ambassador to Rome in order to receive the pallium (white band of wool) as sign of dignity for the newly elected Archbishop Håkon.
Only a year later, Håkon died, and Jon was made the next archbishop in 1268.
The two nicknames of Jon Raude speak of a combative archbishop.
With a red mane, also called hinn stadfasti in Old Norse, which means the stubborn and unchangeable, he fought for the liberty of the Church and its rights in a time when the relation between the kingdom and the Church was unclear.
The Archbishopric in Nidaros was ambitious in the times of the Laws of the Land. It covered geographically most the Norwegian realm and the archbishop wanted to have control over the legislation of Christian law.
When King Magnus tried to introduce the new Frotsating law in 1269, he was stopped, apparently by Jon Raude, who wanted to have his own Church law.
It’s probable that the same law was already accepted by the three other tings in the preceding two years according to the old tradition, with the secular and religious legislation gathered.
The dispute led to a compromise between archbishop and king, first in 1273, then in 1277 with the so-called fence agreement or the concord from Tønsberg.
The fence agreement set mainly up boundaries between the ecclesiastical and the royal authorities, like the right to nominate priests, tax exemption, and the judiciary.
The significance of the concord still arises dispute after many centuries – but now among historians.
